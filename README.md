- 👋 Hi, I’m Vaishnav
- 👀 I’m interested in leanring and exploring new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m was a software engineer back in India. I was on my journey mastering Golang. But....
- 🤖 AI boomed, I fell in love with the way she worked. But again, note that she was dumb than my girlfriend. So....
- 🏫 I joined Dalhousie Univeristy to learn about her (AI) so I can make her more dumb!
